              Why do patients from outside of Cheney, WA seek care here at
              ForestBloom Fertility?
            </h3>
            <h4 class="css-1d2nld">
              ForestBloom Fertility differs from the vast majority of IVF
              programs in the United States in many ways, which explains why
              patients elect to pursue care here even when they live close to
              IVF clinics.

          <div class="css-1ma61i3">
            <h4>1. We offer Natural Cycle IVF and Mini Stim IVF.</h4>
            <p>
              Most of the out-of-town patients seeking care here pursue NC IVF
              or Mini Stim IVF. These two options are not offered at most other
              clinics. For patients with markedly diminished ovarian reserve or
              patients who are uncomfortable with fertilizing more than a single
              egg in an IVF cycle, NC IVF represents an option that they may not
              have known existed. Mini Stim IVF, which usually results in 3-8
              eggs retrieved, is similarly attractive to patients concerned
              about the creation of an excessive number of embryos.
            </p>
            <h4>2. We are a “no discard” facility.</h4>
            <p>
              All fertilized eggs that result in viable embryos are either
              transferred or frozen for future use by our patients. If a couple
              creates these embryos, then it is their responsibility to return
              at a later date to use them. Since the destruction of these extra
              embryos is not an option, we spend a lot of time and effort
              discussing how many eggs to fertilize. Unfertilized eggs can be
              frozen for future use. Embryos that are abandoned will be donated
              to those couples interested in Embryo Adoption.
            </p>
            <h4>
              3. We are open to discussing how a couple’s faith impacts their
              fertility journey.
            </h4>
            <p>
              Infertility treatment is a difficult path to walk for patients of
              faith. Many struggle with how they are called to respond to their
              infertility. Should they pursue treatments like IVF or adoption,
              or just accept their situation? We treat couples of all faiths and
              those with no faith, but we are guided in our approach by our
              faith, which is why we are a “no discard” IVF program.
            </p>
            <h4>4. We do not offer Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT)</h4>
            <p>
              Surprisingly, some patients seek care at ForestBloom Fertility as
              a result of what we do not offer. PGT involves the removal of
              cells from an embryo at the blastocyst stage of development. The
              cells come from the portion of the embryo destined to become the
              placenta. These cells are sent to a genetic testing laboratory and
              the embryo is then frozen, awaiting the result of the testing. The
              unresolved issues regarding PGT include potential damage to the
              embryo from the biopsy, the possibility that the embryo is normal
              in spite of testing suggesting otherwise, and the use of PGT for
              morally problematic issues such as sex selection (a couple chooses
              to discard all male embryos because they only desire a daughter).

            <h3>
              If we are interested in doing IVF at ForestBloom Fertility, how do
              we start?
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the best ways is to sign up for a free consultation with
              us. During this 15-minute telemedicine consult, We can discuss
              your particular situation and whether it makes sense for you to
              consider pursuing IVF here at ForestBloom.
            </p>
            <h3>
              OK, we are sold on the idea of working with ForestBloom. Now what?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The next step is to arrange for either an official telemedicine
              consultation followed by an in-person visit to Cheney or just
              schedule an in-person visit to Cheney.
            </p>
            <h3>Why do we need to come to Cheney for evaluation?</h3>
            <p>
            Patients pursuing IVF need to undergo some specific tests including vaginal ultrasound, a trial embryo transfer (also called a mock transfer or a cervical check), and a saline infused sonogram (also called a water sono) to make sure that there are no fibroids or polyps in the uterine cavity. If you have recently (within 6 months) had this last test, then we can sometimes defer a repeat test if the regular sonogram looks good. The ultrasound is needed to ensure that your ovaries can be easily visualized for monitoring and for performing an egg collection. The ultrasound is also beneficial for determining your Mini Stim protocol, which may be adjusted based on your Antral Follicle Count and your anti Mullerian hormone (AMH) level.

            </p>
            <h3>
              Do we need to come to Cheney for evaluation at a particular
              time in my cycle?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It is best to schedule that visit on day 5-12 of your cycle or
              when you are on the birth control pill to ensure that you are not
              pregnant and that the endometrial lining is thin, which makes the
              saline sonogram a bit easier to interpret.
            </p>
            <h3>Are other tests needed?</h3>
            <p>
              We need to have a recent semen analysis (within 6 months) and both
              members of the couple need to be tested for HIV, Hepatitis B and
              C, and syphilis ( We perform cervical DNA testing for gonorrhea
              and chlamydia at this visit).
            </p>
            <h3>Once we have completed all these tests, what comes next?</h3>
            <p>
              Following the completion of all testing, you and your husband will
              schedule a Final ART consultation, at which time you will make
              some final decisions regarding how many eggs are to be fertilized
              and whether extra eggs will be frozen or discarded. At this time
              you will go over the consent forms, which will need to be signed
              and notarized before you send them back to us here in Cheney.
            </p>
            <h3>How many days will we need to be in Cheney?</h3>
            <p>
              A typical NC IVF and Mini Stim IVF cycle are detailed below. Since
              we batch our IVF patients, you may need to take birth control
              pills or other medications to allow us to align your cycle with
              the clinic schedule. You will need to be in Cheney for
              ultrasound monitoring starting on day 7-8 depending on your
              protocol. Most patients take the hCG trigger shot on day 12 or so.
              A trigger on day 12 means an egg retrieval on day 14. Day 3 embryo
              transfer would be on 17 and day 5 embryo transfer would be on day
              19. The day of embryo transfer you can depart by car, and the day
              after embryo transfer, you are free to fly home. Pregnancy tests
              are scheduled for 11 days after a day 3 ET and 9 days after a day
              5 ET.
